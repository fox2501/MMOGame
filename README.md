# BasicCraft

**Matriculation:** 1302798

A basic strategy game based upon the likes of Cybernations and Tribal Wars.

Each player starts with a few workers and farmers which give them a basic income every time a 'turn' takes place.

Each turn is a cron-job ran to carry out adding an income of gold and food to each user

They then use that food to purchase more workers or farmers. They can also purchase warriors and defenders for attacking other players or defending against them.
